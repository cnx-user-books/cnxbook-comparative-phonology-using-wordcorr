    <para id="delete_me">The keyboard is the most direct way to input data to Wordcorr. You can use the characters you usually use on your computer. You also have full access to the International Phonetic Alphabet (<link document="">IPA</link>) through your keyboard. And you can <link document="">import</link> data from other Wordcorr users, spreadsheets, and some other computer programs. This module deals with ordinary typing.</para><para id="element-852">Once you have an <link document="m13684">entry</link> started on the Data panel, with a primary gloss (and a secondary gloss if this collection has a secondary gloss language designated), you shift your attention to the middle of your screen. There you see the "Add Datum" button, and below it, what starts out as a blank grid where the data you are about to type will reside. Click <term>Add Datum</term>.</para><figure id="element-208"><media id="idm3482160" alt=""><image src="../../media/Data-add.jpg" mime-type="image/jpeg"/></media>
<caption>The Add Datum dialog box, from Wordcorr's Data panel.</caption></figure><para id="element-609">The entry number and the primary gloss are carried in from the entry you were on when you clicked Add Datum. Below that, you fill in the obligatory <term>Variety</term> field by clicking on the darkened bar, which shows you a list of the varieties in your collection. Click on the variety whose datum you are ready to type in.</para><para id="element-265">Next, click inside the <term>Datum</term> window (also obligatory), and type in one form for that variety in that entry. We'll pick up later on Easy IPA, Wordcorr's simplified strategy that gives you quick access to every current IPA symbol.</para><para id="element-688">You can have more than one word in the same speech variety that matches the meaning of the same entry. To begin with, you may not know which one of several possible words reflects the forms you have for the other varieties. Wordcorr doesn't mind if you put in several forms for the same variety; some of them may have a common origin with one group of varieties, and another may match a different group of varieties. But activate Add Datum separately for each form.</para><para id="element-795">There are two more text areas on the Add Datum dialog box. <term>Special Semantics</term> is what you use when the meaning of the word in this variety differs noticeably from the meaning implied by the gloss for the entry as a whole, you put a note in Special Semantics. The French word that matches the word for "house" in other Romance languages is <foreign>chez</foreign>, a preposition, not <foreign>maison</foreign>, the regular French word for "house." So you would put something like "where X lives, preposition" in Special Semantics.</para><para id="element-664"><term>Remarks</term> is an important field. It holds all the information, or conjecture or guess, that Wordcorr doesn't give you a box for, but you feel it may turn out to be important anyway. Write all you like. Nearly everything in Wordcorr has its own Remarks field associated with it. This Remarks field applies only to the single datum you typed in the Datum field.</para><para id="element-409">Then, when you want to keep what you've got, click the OK button at the bottom. Later, if you want, you can come back and <link document="m13706">edit</link> what's there any time, and fill in Special Semantics or Remarks if some new idea comes up.</para><para id="element-76">And if you decide you're not ready to commit what you've typed at least tentatively, click the Cancel button. You'll never see what's in that particular Add Datum dialog box again. If you come back to it, start over from scratch at the Add Datum button on the Data panel.</para>
