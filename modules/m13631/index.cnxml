<caption>Creator role and collaborators from the Collection panel of JG-SulSil12.</caption></figure><para id="delete_me">In terms of internationally established metadata categories,  you are the <term>creator</term> of any collection you initiate, and you are a <term>collaborator</term> on any collection that somebody else initiates and you contribute something to. Anybody else who contributes to your collection is a collaborator too. For example, if you make additions or  corrections to the data in somebody else’s collection, or if you set up a separate view to do your own analysis, or modify an existing view, you are a collaborator.</para><para id="element-652">Being a creator doesn’t necessarily mean you did all the field work or the analysis or paid the bills. There is a standard list of <term>roles</term> from which you can choose the role for the creator of a collection. I am the creator of JG-SulSel12 in the example, but my role as creator is “annotator” because I took data from a published source and reworked it to fit the form Wordcorr requires, though I did none of the field work. Yet if I hadn’t planned it all out and set it up, the Wordcorr collection wouldn’t exist. This particular work is my baby. I’m not an author of the work I took it from, though I got permission from the authors ahead of time to use their data in this way. Furthermore, in the collection’s metadata I give full information on the published source, so there is never any question about who did what.</para><note id="idp2622320">The <link url="http://purl.org/dc/">Dublin Core</link> is the basic international schema for metadata on published works. OLAC (the <link url="http://www.language-archives.org/OLAC/1.0/">Open Language Archives Consortium</link> is an extension to the Dublin Core specifically for linguistics.</note>
